# Personal portfolio

The main goal of the application - create an extendable system for managing different assets in personal portfolios and finally get rid of hard-to-maintain huge spreadsheets with custom formulas.

At the very begining I used to manage all my portfolios in Google Spreadsheets.
I have different accounts in several broker companies and banks with the very different nature(cash, saving accounts, funds, experimental assets like cryptocurrencies, etc.).

Now I plan to replace my sheets with the app that allow me to replace all that sheets and collect data from different accounts.
