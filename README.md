# Personal portfolio

The main goal of the application - create an extendable system for managing different assets in personal portfolios and finally get rid of hard-to-maintain huge spreadsheets with custom formulas.

At the very beginning, I used to manage all my portfolios in Google Spreadsheets. I have different accounts in several broker companies and banks with a very different nature(cash, savings accounts, funds, experimental assets like cryptocurrencies, etc.).

Now I plan to replace my sheets with the app that allows me to replace all those sheets and collect data from different accounts.
